Oh, the new-chum went to the back block run,
But he should have gone there last week.
He tramped ten miles with a loaded gun,
But of turkey or duck he saw never a one,
For he should have been there last week,
 They said,
There were flocks of ’em there last week.

He wended his way to a waterfall,
And he should have gone there last week.
He carried a camera, legs and all,
But the day was hot, and the stream was small,
For he should have gone there last week,
 They said.
They drowned a man there last week.

He went for a drive, and he made a start,
Which should have been made last week,
For the old horse died of a broken heart;
So he footed it home and he dragged the cart—
But the horse was all right last week,
 They said.
He trotted a match last week.

So he asked the bushies who came from far
To visit the town last week,
If they’d dine with him, and they said ‘Hurrah!’
But there wasn’t a drop in the whisky jar—
You should have been here last week,
 He said,
I drank it all up last week!
